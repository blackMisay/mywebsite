        <h1>Welcome to C#</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>C# pronounced as 'C-sharp', is an elegant object-oriented language that enables developer to build a variety of secure and robust applications 
           that runs in the .Net Framework. </br>
           By the help of C#, we can developed different applications like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows applications</li>
            <li>Web services</li>
            <li>Mobile applications</li>
            <li>Client-server applications</li>
            <li>Distributed applications</li>
            <li>Database applications and much more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The .Net Framework</h3>
        <p>The .Net framework is consist of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the .Net Framework library. </br>
           The <strong>CLR</strong> is the foundation of the .Net framework. It manages code at execution time, providing core services such as 
           memory management, code accuracy, and many other aspect of your code. </br>
           The <strong>class library</strong> is a collection of classes, interfaces, and value types that enable you to accomplish a range of 
           common programming tasks, such as data collection, file access, and working with text. </br>
           <strong>C#</strong> programs use the .Net Framework class library extensively to do common tasks and provide various functionalities.
        </p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            Anders Hejlsberg is known as the founder of C# language, and its current version is 6.0 and is provided and maintained by Microsoft. </br>
            C# is based on C++ and Java, but it has many additional extensions used to perform component oriented approach. </br>
            C# has evolved much since its first release in the year 2002. It was introduced with .Net Framework 1.0.

        <h3>Features</h3>
            <ol type="1" id="features">
                <li>Simple</li>
                    It provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types, etc.
                <li>Modern programming language</li>
                    It is based on the current trend and it is very powerful and simple building scalable, interoperable and robust applications.
                <li>Object-oriented</li>
                    OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedural-oriented language which is not easy to manage when the application grows.
                <li>Type safe</li>
                    C# type safe code can only access the memory location that it has permission to execute. Therefore, it improves a security of the program.
                <li>Interoperability</li>
                    It enables programs to do almost anything that a native C++ application do.
                <li>Scalable and Updateable</li>
                    It's automatic scalable and updatable language. For updating our application we delete the old files and update them with new ones.
                <li>Component oriented</li>
                    It's predominant software development methodology used to develop more robust and highly sclable applications.
                <li>Structured programming language</li>
                    C# is a structured language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is  easy to understand and modify.
                <li>Rich Library</li>
                    It provides a lot of in-built functions that makes the development fast.
                <li>Fast speed</li>
                    The compilation and execution time is fast.
